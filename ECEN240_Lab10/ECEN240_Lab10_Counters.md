ECEN 240 - Lab 10 -- Counters
=============================

## Name: <span style="color:red;">    [insert your name here]</span>


Purposes:
=========

1.  Become familiar with applications involving flip flops.

2.  Be able to implement synchronous counters.

3.  Use digital simulation software to design and simulate a sequential
    logic circuit.

4.  Learn about, and use, asynchronous control inputs on flip flops.

Procedure:
==========

In this lab you will implement three different globally synchronous
counters:

-   A 3-bit **Up-Counter**

-   A 3-bit **Ring Counter** with a "reset" signal

-   A 2-bit **Gray Code Counter with an "Inc" input**

There will be a 3-part quiz\--one part for each counter. The quiz parts
are intended to be taken before you build the counter so that you can
verify that your design equations are correct.


> **Up-Counter Design**
>
> The counter design will begin with a transition table for the Input
> Forming Logic (IFL). Fill out the required next state values in the
> transition table for a 3-bit globally synchronous **up-counter**
> (remember that globally synchronous means that the clock inputs of all
> the FFs are connected to the same clock signal):

> IFL (left menu) *and implement the IFL design.* The inputs are *Q2*,
> *Q1*, and *Q0*. The outputs are *N2*, *N1*, and *N0*.

**Completing the Up-Counter**

The counter will not "count" without the flip flops:

-   Open the "main" circuit and connect the IFL next-state signals (N2,
    N1, and N0) to the flip flops.

-   Wire the rest of the counter.

    -   The "clk" signal should be connected to the flip flops.

    -   The flip flop outputs should be connected to the output ports

    -   The flip flop outputs should also be connected to the input of
        the input forming logic (IFL).

-   Manually test the up-counter (The Logisim clock input is controlled
    with the "Tick once," "Ticks Enabled" and "Tick Frequency" items
    found under the "Simulate" menu).

-   Simulate the counter using the *Logisim* "Chronogram" tool as you
    did in Lab 8. Here are a couple of reminders:

    -   Place an extra clock symbol from the "wiring" menu, and label it
        "sysclk", but don't connect it to anything (sysclk won't appear
        in the final timing diagram).

    -   Open the Chronogram window and select the signals you want to
        display (move them to the right window). You will want both
        clocks and all three output signals.

    -   Click on the clock symbol at the top of the Chronogram for each
        Â½ clock cycle you wish to simulate (simulate one complete
        counting sequence):

**Ring Counter Design**

> In this 3-bit synchronous ring counter there will be a reset signal to
> reset the counter to the '001' state using the set and reset inputs on
> the D flip flops (the reset signal will connect to the "set" pin of
> one of the flip flops, and to the "reset" pin of two of the flip flops
> to initialize to "001").

> A ring counter has one bit that is "true" or "asserted" at a time.

### Write the minimized Boolean equations for the next state signals, N2, N1, and N0:

  ------
  N2 =
  ------

  ------
  N1 =
  ------

  ------
  N0 =
  ------

What do you notice about the minimized Boolean equations? Will you need any logic gates to implement this design? Can you anticipate would happen if you do not use a reset signal to set the initial count to "001"? To verify your design is correct:

## <span style="color:red;">\*\*\* Take the Second part of Lab 10 Quiz 1 \*\*\* </span>

(This is a 3-part quiz, and the second part is worth 7 points)

**Build the Ring-Counter**

> Download the "Ring\_Counter.circ" file template from the Lab 10
> module. Since your design does not require any logic gates for the
> input forming logic, you will not need a subcircuit for the IFL. Your
> entire design can be completed with 3 flip flops (but don't forget the
> reset signal)!
>

To build the complete counter:

-   Connect the flip flops to each other.

-   Connect the clock to the flip flops

-   Connect the "reset" input pin to the appropriate "set" and "reset"
    signals.

-   Connect the flip flop outputs to the Q2, Q1, and Q0 pins

-   Manually test the ring counter as you did with the Up-Counter.

-   Simulate the counter using the *Logisim* "Chronogram" tool as you
    did in the Up-Counter (remember the "sysclk" pin).

You will not need a test vector file to verify that your circuit is functional, but after you have verified that your ring counter is counting correctly, run the Chronogram timing simulation.
