# ECEN-240 Lab Repository
This repository contains the material and instructions for students enrolled in BYU-Idaho's ECEN-240 class to complete the concurrent labs.  

## Comments
Originally written in MSWORD (the .DOCX files are still included), these labs have been re-formatted and updated into the MarkDown language and are being maintained in Github.  The refresh also includes graphics that are reflective of the latest version (**3.8.0**) of Logicsim, so as to promote the use of the most-recent release of that software.  

### Motivations for this change:

1. By providing content in a browser-accessible format, the path is prepared for considering an universal online-distribution
2. MarkDown, required by other ECEN/CSE courses, is generally a simpler, non-proprietary document format, for students to edit
3. BYU-I, as a Github enterprise customer, provides the framework for college/department support and easy ownership transition with personnel changes
4. Delivery of the labs and any other associated class collateral (for example, a full Vivado project template/files) is now easily done and supported with the repository framework.
5. This format provides the option to use Github Classrooms as the delivery framework for the material.  This opens possibilities to prepare customized per-student, delivery.  This can be useful, should the decision to implement anti-cheating or other online detractors.
6. Future Logisim updates and associated GUI changes should be easily supportable in this format.

### Usage
With the content prepared and aggregated in here, there are multiple approaches for delivery content to students (in recommended order):

**a.**) <ins>**Deliver from Github Classroom**</ins>

This approach will necessitate an incremental learning for some students, as they will have to be familiar with the concept of Github, revision control, etc.  Probably 50% of ECEN-240 students are already familiar these tools and concepts.   

As a complete, unique, private repository is created for each student to clone, the students can modify and submit any number of files, including fully-completed Vivado projects.

- **Homework submission**:  The entire repo, including the modified MarkDown document(s)  is 'pushed' back to the classroom.  A *URL* to the student's repo is submitted and flags the submission date to iLearn.

**b.**) <ins> **Deliver as a cloneable repository link**</ins>

By cloning to their own local repositories, students get more valuable experience of working with within an industry-standard revision control framework, and preparing the material to be an item in their 'portfolio' of projects, showable to recruiters/others.

- **Homework submission**:  The modified respective MarkDown document(s) is(are) uploaded as a file(s) on iLearn.

**c.**) <ins>**Deliver from iLearn with links as individual files**</ins>

Providing links to the repository let the students view immediately online, download, and edit the lab responses.  NO revision control experience is involved here.

- **Homework submission**:  The modified respective MarkDown document(s) is(are) uploaded as a file(s) on iLearn.

**d.**) <ins>**Deliver from copies made to iLearn**</ins>
Copying the material into iLearn, then providing links to the copies of the files in the course is possible too, but requires more work, defeats the universal approach to version control, and brings into question the distribution of changes across sections thru the semester.

- **Homework submission**:  The modified respective MarkDown document(s) is(are) uploaded as a file(s) on iLearn.
